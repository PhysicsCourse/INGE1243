    "Now that we saw the importance of the carthesian coordinates system, let's have a look to another important one: the **polar coordinate system**. \n",

    "Taking back the painting of Kandinsky, from a specified origin, I would like to locate the center of one of the **blue circle** depicted on the painting. Suppose for a moment that you have the power to communicate with ants. Your best ant friend is located at the origin and you want to tell her how to reach point $P$.\n",

    "You already used your power to educate ants and so you know she has basic notions in geometry (lines, circles, etc.). You tell her to go a distance $u$ along a straight line (red) that you draw on the painting and then to follow the circle path (blue) and travel a distance $v$. $u$ and $v$ are expressed in meter because you assume she knows about the SI units. $u$ defines a **segment** and $v$ defines an **arclength**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arriving at point $P$, the ant tells you that you have to be careful with the signs of $u$ and $v$. Indeed, she assumed that you gave her positive values and that you respected the convention regarding the angle (counterclockwise is positive and clockwise, negative). With two coordinates, there could have been 4 points that you were talking about $(u,v)$ (point $P$), $(-u,v)$ (green point), $(-u,-v)$ (orange points), $(u,-v)$ (purple point). She also let you know that she knows about **similitudes** and that the $v$ coordinate could be divided by $u$ - in order to be in correspondancy with the arclength on the **unit circle**. In such case, you could have specified as well an angle in **radian** ($\\theta=\\frac{v}{u}$). Also, since we are dealing with circles, $u$ could as well be noted $r$ (which she finds more suitable). \n",
    "\n",
    "With such coordinate system, you are now able to communicate **every** point, from the origin, uniquely with $r$ ranging from $0$ to $\\infty$ and $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Knowing that the original painting is $201\\times140 cm²$, we can **measure** the coordinates of point $P$ with respect to the origin (with 2 digits, in cm and radian): \n",

It is also referred to as the **moment**, **moment of force**. It represents the capability of a force to produce change in the rotational motion of the body. The concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers, which is reflected in his famous quote: \"Give me a **lever** and a place to stand and I will move the Earth\".
